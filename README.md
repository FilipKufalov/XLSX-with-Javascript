Maybe you want to have an internal page to share information with your employees or an online page with statistics. You can easily achieve this with the method I'll present. All you need to do is change the values on line 16 and line 18 in script.js based on the number of rows in your Excel document. If you have more knowledge of JavaScript, you can customize the code as desired. This option makes it simpler for your colleagues, and the results will be quickly noticed or transmitted to others without involving other departments in your company. This method is the easiest because it doesn't require additional tools or programming languages like JavaScript, making it accessible to many people in the sector.
